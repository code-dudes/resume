This repo contains resume templates. These are simple resume templates built using Google Docs. These are easy to customize and use for anyone. No need to learn LaTeX (it's good, but takes time). 

You can easily create multiple copies for different companies and send to recruiters(download as PDF `File->Download->PDF`)

**Note:** While opening on phone, use print layout to see how it's going to look. Still Mobile view might have issues, so view on Desktop/Laptop or use `Desktop View` in mobile browser. Also see tips section
